# SQL JavaFX
Application written in Java to send SQL requests to a database.   
Implements a [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) graphical interface.  
The database can be setup with the included SQL file.   
Uses [JPA (Jakarta Persistence)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/jakarta-persistence-jpa.html) to interpret the SQL tables as Java classes.  
This project was made with [Martin Medina](https://github.com/medinammartin3) for the IFT2935 UdeM course.  
Here is a [Presentation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-kplptDosA) of the project.
